# "Nature Valley": a modular soundscape

Nature Valley is a modular soundscape that allows users to customize ambient sounds. 
Users can mix and match four soundscapes: urban noise, wind chimes, waves, and "techno" rainforests. Users also have the freedom to manipulate pitch and amplitude for each sound.
